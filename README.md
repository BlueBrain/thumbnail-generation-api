# Thumbnail Generation API

## Overview

The Thumbnail Generation API provides the service for generating thumbnails of morphologies/electrophysiologies and the soma of morphologies. The API is designed to receive a `content_url` from a BBP Nexus resource (morphology or electrophysiology) and produce a corresponding thumbnail image.

## Install

To get started with the Thumbnail Generation API, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/BlueBrain/thumbnail-generation-api.git
    cd thumbnail-generation-api
    ```

2. **Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)**
    
3. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```sh
    poetry install
    ```

4. **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

Your Thumbnail Generation API should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Examples

Here are some simple examples to get you started with using the Thumbnail Generation API:

1. **Generate a thumbnail for electrophysiologies:**
    ```sh
    curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/generate/trace-image?content_url=https://bbp.epfl.ch/nexus/v1/files/public/hippocampus/https%3A%2F%2Fbbp.epfl.ch%2Fneurosciencegraph%2Fdata%2Fb67a2aa6-d132-409b-8de5-49bb306bb251" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN"
    ```

2. **Generate a thumbnail for morphologies:**
    ```sh
    curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/generate/morphology-image?content_url=https://bbp.epfl.ch/nexus/v1/files/bbp/mouselight/https%3A%2F%2Fbbp.epfl.ch%2Fnexus%2Fv1%2Fresources%2Fbbp%2Fmouselight%2F_%2F0befd25c-a28a-4916-9a8a-adcd767db118" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN"
    ```
