    Get the current user based on the provided authentication token.

    This function serves as a dependency for FastAPI routes that require user authentication.
    It contains the actual authentication logic, such as token validation. If authentication
    is successful, it should return the current user. Otherwise, it should raise an HTTPException
    with the appropriate status code and message.

    For testing, you can mock the behavior or provide a test user.

    This function is intended for use in testing scenarios where you want to simulate
    authentication without performing actual token validation. For example, it can
    return a test user or raise an HTTPException to simulate authentication failure.

    :param token: The authentication token.
